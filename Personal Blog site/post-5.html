        <h5>Exercise 1: Your relationship Vision</h5>
                    
        <p><strong>Time</strong>:Approximately 60 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Purpose</strong>: This exercise will help you see the potential in your relationship.</p>
        <p><strong>Comments</strong>: Do this exercise together.</p>
        <br>

        <p>
            <strong>Directions 1</strong><br> Take out two sheets of paper, one for each of you. Working separately, write a series of short sentences that describe your personal vision of a deeply satisfying love relationship. Include qualities you already have that you want to keep and qualities you wish you had. Write each sentence in the present tense, as if it were already happening. For example: “We have fun together.” “We have great sex.” “We are loving parents.” “We are affectionate with each other.” Make all your items positive statements. Write: “We settle our differences peacefully.” rather than “We don’t fight.”  
        </p><br>
        <p>
            <strong>Directions 2</strong><br> Share your sentences. Note the items that you have in common and underline them. (It doesn’t matter if you have used different words, as long as the general idea is the same.) If your partner has written sentences that you agree with but did not think of yourself, add them to your list. For the moment, ignore items that are not shared.

        <h5>Exercise 2: Childhood Wounds</h5>
        <p>
            <strong>Directions 1</strong><br> First do some slow stretching exercises to help you relax. Then settle into a comfortable chair. Breathe deeply ten times, becoming more relaxed with each breath.  
        </p><br>
        <p>
            <strong>Directions 2</strong><br> When you are feeling peaceful, close your eyes and imagine your childhood home, the earliest one you can recall.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> their positive and negative traits. Tell them what you enjoyed about being with them. Tell them what you didn’t like about being with them. Finally, tell them what you wanted from them but never got. Don’t hesitate to share your angry, hurt, or sad feelings. In your fantasy, your caretakers will be grateful for your insights.
