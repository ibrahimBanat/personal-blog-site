            Feelings of unity that a child experiences in the womb and in the first few months of life gradually fades, giving way to a drive to be a distinct self. The essential state of unity remains, but there is a glimmer of awareness of the external world. It is during this stage of development that the child makes the monumental discovery that its mother, the gentle giant who holds it and feeds it and makes such comforting sounds, is not always there.
        </p>
        <blockquote>In reality, we live in everyone. I live in you. You live in me. There is no gap, no distance. We all are eternally one.</blockquote>

            A child who has painful experiences early in life will either feel cut off from those around him or will attempt to fuse with them, not knowing where he leaves off and others begin. This lack of firm boundaries will be a recurring problem in marriage. As a child grows older, eros is directed not only to the mother but also to the father, siblings, and the world as a whole.

            I remember when my daughter Leah was three years old and wanted to explore everything around her. She had so much vitality that she could run all day long and not be tired.
